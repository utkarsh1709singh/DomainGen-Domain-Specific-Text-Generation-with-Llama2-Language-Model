*"DomainGen: Domain-Specific Text Generation with Llama2 Language Models"*

**Description:** 
DomainGen is a project focused on deploying, fine-tuning, and evaluating Llama2 language models for domain-specific text generation tasks. Leveraging AWS SageMaker and Jupyter notebooks, this project provides a comprehensive framework for deploying pre-trained models, fine-tuning them with domain-specific datasets, and evaluating their performance.

Steps:

1. Deployment on AWS SageMaker:

+ Create an AWS account if you don't have one.
+ Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to Amazon SageMaker.
+ Follow the instructions to create a new notebook instance.
+ Clone the GitHub repository containing the project code to the notebook instance.
+ Set up the environment and dependencies required for deploying the Llama2 model.
  
2. Pre-trained Model Evaluation:

+ Use the provided Jupyter notebook for pre-trained model evaluation.
+ Execute the notebook cells to assess the model's performance on domain-specific content.
+ Document the model's responses to domain-specific inputs.
3. Fine-tuning with Domain Data:

+ Prepare domain-specific datasets (Financial, Healthcare, IT) for fine-tuning.
+ Use the provided Jupyter notebook for fine-tuning the Llama2 model.
+ Execute the notebook cells to fine-tune the model with the chosen domain data.
+ Verify the fine-tuning process and document the results.

*4. Deployment of Fine-tuned Model:*

+ Follow the AWS SageMaker deployment steps outlined in the provided notebook.
+ Configure the deployment settings and deploy the fine-tuned Llama2 model.
+ Verify the deployment and document the steps and screenshots.
*5. Evaluation of Fine-tuned Model:*

+ Use the provided Jupyter notebook to evaluate the fine-tuned model's performance.
+ Provide domain-specific inputs to the model and analyze the generated outputs.
+ Document any improvements or changes in the model's performance post-fine-tuning.



*Version Control:*

Utilize Git for version control to track changes and collaborate with team members.
Commit changes regularly and follow best practices for branching and merging.
By following these steps and documenting the process thoroughly, DomainGen provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in domain-specific text generation using Llama2 language models.
